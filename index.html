		<p>Health is Wealth. It is as simple as that. When we are healthy, we are better able to face challenges and give our best to whatever endeavor we undertake. Stress is a leading cause of chronic health problems, including colds, viruses, headaches, overeating, sleeplessness and smoking; the more health problems that your employees endure, the higher your health care costs will be.
		</p><p>
		As we know health is also important in our life. If health is good then we can able to overwhelm all things and all these luxuries life styles becomes handle easily.
		</p><p>
		So I believe that yoga plays an important role to become healthy and wealthy life. Yoga controls your mind as well as maintaining our body healthy.

		<summary>Cardiovascular Disease</summary>
<p>Many studies suggest that psychologically demanding jobs that allow employees little control over the work process increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Musculoskeletal Disorders</summary>
<p>On the basis of research by NIOSH and many other organizations, it is widely believed that job stress increases the risk for development of back and upper- extremity musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Psychological Disorders</summary>
<p>Several studies suggest that differences in rates of mental health problems (such as depression and burnout) for various occupations are due partly to differences in job stress levels. (Economic and lifestyle differences between occupations may also contribute to some of these problems.)</p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Heart Disease</summary>
<p>A personality has a higher risk of high blood pressure and heart problems. Stress can directly increase heart rate and blood flow, and causes the release of cholesterol and triglycerides into the blood stream. It's also possible that stress is related to other problems -- an increased likelihood of smoking or obesity -- that indirectly increase the heart risks. Doctors do know that sudden emotional stress can be a trigger for serious cardiac problems, including heart attacks.</p> 
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Asthma</summary>
<p>Many studies have shown that stress can worsen asthma. Some evidence suggests that a parent's chronic stress might even increase the risk of developing asthma in their children. One study looked at how parental stress affected the asthma rates of young children who were also exposed to air pollution or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. The kids with stressed out parents had a substantially higher risk of developing asthma.</p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Obesity</summary>
<p>Excess fat in the belly seems to pose greater health risks than fat on the legs or hips -- and unfortunately, that's just where people with high stress seem to store it. "Stress causes higher levels of the hormone cortisol," says Winner, "and that seems to increase the amount of fat that's deposited in the abdomen." </p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Diabetes </summary>
<p>Stress can worsen diabetes in two ways. First, it increases the likelihood of bad behaviors, such as unhealthy eating and excessive drinking. Second, stress seems to raise the glucose levels of people with type 2 diabetes directly.</p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Headaches</summary>
<p>Stress is considered one of the most common triggers for headaches -- not just tension headaches, but migraines as well. Depression and anxiety. It's probably no surprise that chronic stress is connected with higher rates of depression and anxiety. One survey of recent studies found that people who had stress related to their jobs -- like demanding work with few rewards -- had an 80% higher risk of developing depression within a few years than people with lower stress.</p> 
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Gastrointestinal problems</summary>
</p>Here's one thing that stress doesn't do -- it doesn't cause ulcers. However, it can make them worse. Stress is also a common factor in many other GI conditions, such as chronic heartburn (or gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Winner says. Alzheimer's disease. One animal study found that stress might worsen Alzheimer's disease, causing its brain lesions to form more quickly. Some researchers speculate that reducing stress has the potential to slow down the progression of the disease.</p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Accelerated aging</summary>
<p>There's actually evidence that stress can affect how you age. One study compared the DNA of mothers who were under high stress -- they were caring for a chronically ill child -- with women who were not. Researchers found that a particular region of the chromosomes showed the effects of accelerated aging. Stress seemed to accelerate aging about 9 to 17 additional years.</p>
		</details><br/>
		<details>
		<summary>Premature death</summary>
<p>A study looked at the health effects of stress by studying elderly caregivers looking after their spouses -- people who are naturally under a great deal of stress. It found that caregivers had a 63% higher rate of death than people their age who were not caregivers.</p>
